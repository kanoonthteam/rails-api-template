# Security Checklist

This Rails API template has been audited for security. Here's the status of security measures:

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### Configuration
- [x] All database passwords use environment variables
- [x] Devise mailer sender uses environment variable
- [x] Production host configuration uses environment variable
- [x] Master key is properly gitignored
- [x] Environment example file provided (.env.example)
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in codebase

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Devise configured for secure password handling
- [x] OAuth2 tokens expire after 24 hours
- [x] Refresh tokens implemented for better security
- [x] Admin dashboard protected with HTTP Basic Auth
- [x] Account assignment restricted (no mass assignment vulnerability)

### Code Security
- [x] Brakeman security scan passes with 0 warnings
- [x] RuboCop configured for code quality
- [x] SQL injection prevention via Active Record
- [x] Parameter filtering for sensitive data
- [x] CSRF protection for API endpoints

### Production Security
- [x] SSL enforced in production
- [x] Secure headers configured
- [x] Asset pipeline disabled (API-only)
- [x] Debug mode disabled in production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Actions Before Production

1. **Update CORS Configuration**
   - File: `config/initializers/cors.rb`
   - Change `origins '*'` to your specific domains

2. **Configure Rails Credentials**
   ```bash
   rails credentials:edit
   ```
   Add your production AWS credentials and other secrets

3. **Set Strong Passwords**
   - Admin dashboard password
   - Database password
   - Any API keys or secrets

4. **Configure Email**
   - Set up SMTP settings for password reset emails
   - Update DEVISE_MAILER_SENDER

5. **Review OAuth Applications**
   - Create separate OAuth apps for each environment
   - Use strong client secrets
   - Implement token rotation policy

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit .env files (only .env.example)
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep Rails and gems updated
   - Run `bundle audit` regularly
   - Monitor security advisories

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar)
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Log security events

4. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Regular database backups
   - Test restore procedures
   - Secure backup storage
